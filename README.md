# Controle
Codes created for Control and Automation classes

All Matlab routines solves problems proposed by the respective PDFs files (subject evaluation).

Part 1 - Jury method for stability analysis / variation of K (Proportional control of systems) / impulse and step response.  
Part 2 - System Transfer function (closed loop) / step reponse analysis / root locus.  
Part 3 - System with compensation / transfer function / step reponse analysis.  
Part 4 - Control system based on root locus (open loop) / project especifications / discretization of system / stability analysis / steady state analysis for impulse and ramp response.
